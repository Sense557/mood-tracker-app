## Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js, JavaScript, CSS
State Management: React Context API / Redux (if applicable)
Backend: [API or backend service used, e.g., Firebase, Node.js, Express]
Database: [MongoDB, Firebase, LocalStorage, etc.]

## Features
Add mood entries with a simple input form.
View mood history with a timeline or chart visualization.
Edit or delete previously logged moods.
Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Challenges Faced
- State Management: Implementing smooth state transitions while logging moods and keeping the UI responsive was a challenge. I used the Context API to manage the state and Redux for more complex state handling.
- Visualization: Displaying mood data over time was tricky initially, but using chart libraries like Chart.js or D3.js helped create effective visualizations.
- UX/UI: Designing a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and encourages users to log their moods consistently.

## Assumptions & Decisions
- Data Format: It was assumed that mood data would be stored with a simple text description and a timestamp.
- Libraries: Chose React for building the frontend due to its efficiency with state management and reactivity.
- User Interaction: The app assumes users would interact daily, so it provides daily mood logging prompts.
